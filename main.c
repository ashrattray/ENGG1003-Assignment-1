/* the following code has multiple functions. The first function reads a word from the user, and then reads a key for the rotational cipher before 
encrypting the given word with the key and printing the result to the screen.
The second function decrypts an encrypted word in a similar way, with the encrypted word 
and the key (number of rotations) needs to be known in order to decrypt it. It also prints the original 
word to the screen. The third and fourth functions work the same way respictevely, however uses 
the method of a substitution cipher rather than a rotational cipher. 
The use is prompted to input all information needeed for the program to work. 
Words can only be a single word or the program will exit, as when the string reads empty space (i.e. a space) it
recognises it as the end of the string and exits. Therefore, if a sentence is to be decrypted, each word must be input into the program
separately (one at a time).   
This code has been optimised in order to allow the input of capital and lower case letters, and allows the input of common
punctuation such as apostrophes, as well as numbers; however spaces still cause the program to 
quit and should be avoided.  
Program must be run from the terminal section */
