/* The following function defines how the program will decrypt a given encrypted word when not given the key for the number of rotations. 
This is done by initialising the key value k to one, and increasing this at the end of every loop until the user indicates that the decryption 
is correct with a particular key value. This function takes the inputed text in the string 'word' passed from the main.c function, as well 
as the initialised k as 1 to begin testing different keys in decryption. It also uses the unsigned char i to be used as a position pointer within
reading the string 'word' to consecutively decrypt the string once the correct key is found and indicated to be correct by the user. This function worls 
the same as the rkdecrypt function for decryption of a rotational cipher when given the key. This function does not have any return values, as the decrypted text is printed within it in 
order to allow for the use of the switch statement to define whether the decryption is correct or not, and allow the new values of k to be used 
within the same decryption while loop. If the string 'word' was returned to main.c each time to be printed and ask the user if it is correct, the code would be 
incredibly more complicated and likely contain more bugs. This function has only one data type restriction, which is that the character inputted into the switch statement 
must be an integer, as described by the initialisation as int for r. */
