'word' passed from the main.c and decrypts it using the string 'ciphertext' also passed from main.c. The return value 
is only the string 'word' containing the single decrypted letter which is passed back to main.c to be printed before the next 
character in the file is passed to this function to also be encrypted until the end of the file is reached. Like sdecrypt, it uses 
the position counters of in i and k to be compared to eachother, and the value of k is then used to find the initial letter before 
encryption. */
